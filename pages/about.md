### I make stuff.
--- 
I am a human, artist and researcher, exploring the intersection of art, technology, and geopolitics. With a background in sculpture from Concordia University in Montreal, in addition to holding a data science certificate from HarvardX, and a masters in computational arts from Goldsmiths University. I am particularly interested in the ways in which data visualisation and kinetic art can be used to convey complex information in a more engaging and interactive way. I frequently incorporate digital media and fabrication techniques into my artistic practice.
