## Overview

 ![image](https://mirkoPortfolio.b-cdn.net/MECHANICUS/0.jpg)
Mechanicus is a physical representation of the unsustainable control an individual can exert over multiple companies through stock investment. It's a self-destructing machine that interprets live stock data, activating 25 modules of servo motors and gearing systems to reflect stock changes. The project highlights the fragility and eventual collapse of a system driven solely by profit

## Concept

 ![image](https://mirkoPortfolio.b-cdn.net/MECHANICUS/4.jpg)
Inspired by research in mass psychology, macroeconomics, and geo-politics, Mechanicus aims to expose the intricate workings of our economic system. It emphasizes how a single human's control over multiple corporations, driven only by profit, is unsustainable. The project symbolizes how this greed-driven approach neglects customer needs, employee well-being, and environmental sustainability.
