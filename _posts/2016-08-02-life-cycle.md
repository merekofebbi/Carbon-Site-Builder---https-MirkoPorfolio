Three significant factors make the formation of a friendship possible:

* Proximity – nearness or having a place or places to interact
* Repeated, unplanned interactions
* A setting that encourages people to confide in each other

## Dissolution
Friendships end for many different reasons. Sometimes friends move away from each other and the relationship wanes due to the distance. Digital technology has however made geographic distance less of an obstacle to maintaining a friendship. Sometimes divorce causes an end to friendships, as people drop one or both of the divorcing people. For young people, friendships may end as a result of acceptance into new social groups.

Friendships may end by fading quietly away or may end suddenly. How and whether to talk about the end of a friendship is a matter of etiquette that depends on the circumstances.

We deliver CPD training for your staff or networks on AI and the environment. AI is creating exciting new opportunities in the sustainability space, just as it is elsewhere. But AI itself can have a significant carbon footprint, often invisible to the end-user. What does your organization need to know about AI and climate change? How can you show leadership within your organizational constraints?
